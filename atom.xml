The main feature is religious criticism. Philosophy is speculative philosophy.<br> They believed that the problem in Germany at that time was not a problem of actual social change, but mainly a problem of backward thinking. So their views are only reflected in their thoughts, not in their actions. So Marx believed that they seemed radical, but they were actually the most conservative.</li><li>The Hegelian obligatory school is the old school&#x2F;systematic school, and the place of activity is in Berlin.</li><li>True socialism: A trend of thought that arose in the German intellectual circles at that time. These socialists gave their ideas a real name, which was very arrogant. This reflected the hyperbole and arrogance of the German ideological circle at that time, believing that only German science could give socialism a solid foundation. They are keen on theoretical speculation, and their theoretical basis comes from the Young Hegelians.</li><li>What they all have in common is that they stay at using words to refute some words and sentences, and they stay at the internal struggle of ideology. In order to realize the healthy development of German society, it is objectively necessary to criticize these ideologies.</li></ol><h2 id="Clarify-the-philosophical-insights-of-Marx-and-Engels-themselves"><a href="#Clarify-the-philosophical-insights-of-Marx-and-Engels-themselves" class="headerlink" title="Clarify the philosophical insights of Marx and Engels themselves."></a>Clarify the philosophical insights of Marx and Engels themselves.</h2><p>Both had participated in the Young Hegelian movement.

At the same time, it clarifies the new worldview formed at that time.</p><h1 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h1><h2 id="On-the-Starting-Point-of-Historical-Materialism"><a href="#On-the-Starting-Point-of-Historical-Materialism" class="headerlink" title="On the Starting Point of Historical Materialism"></a>On the Starting Point of Historical Materialism</h2><ol><li><p>The fundamental error of the Hegelian philosophers was that they did not have the correct starting point for social-historical theory.</p><blockquote><p>“Their polemics with Hegel and with each other were limited to the fact that each of them grasped some aspect of Hegel’s system against his system as a whole, or against those seized by others. Aspect.” - “The Complete Works of Marx and Engels”, Volume III, p. 21</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This demand to change consciousness is, in the final analysis, a demand to interpret what exists in another way, that is to say, to recognize what exists by another interpretation, although the young Hegelian thinkers are full of words. Shake the world,” when in fact they are the biggest conservatives. —— “The Complete Works of Marx and Engels”, Volume 3, page 22</p></blockquote></li><li><p>What is the premise of history and what is the starting point: the premise of the new view of history is real individuals, their activities, and their material living conditions.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>The premises with which we begin are not arbitrary, they are not dogmas, but real premises which can be thrown aside only in the imagination, real individuals, their activities and their material conditions of life. —— “The Complete Works of Marx and Engels”, Volume 3, page 23</p></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before reading <em>Counselling for Toads: A Psychological Adventure</em>,I read Alfred Adler’s <em>What Life Should Mean to You</em> which states how deeply the childhood can affect  us. In Robert’s book,I learned more details about views in the form of  animal perspectives.</p><p><img src="/2022/12/28/Some-insights-from-Robert-de-Board-s-Counselling-for-Toads-A-Psychological-Adventure/adventure.jpg"></p><h2 id="A-life-axis"><a href="#A-life-axis" class="headerlink" title="A life axis"></a>A life axis</h2><p>When we’re four or five years old, we try to ask ourselves two questions:</p><ul><li>Am I well-bing?</li><li>Are others well-being?</li></ul><p>Different answers will build <strong>a life axis</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="left"></th><th>I’m fine.</th><th>I’m not fine.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">You’re fine.</td><td>Zone A</td><td>Zone B</td></tr><tr><td align="left">You’re not fine.</td><td>Zone C</td><td>Zone D</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When we are in Zone B,we’ll fall into a spiral of inferiority. We’re going to play a PLOM(poor little old me). We hope that no matter what we do, we will be loved and respected by others.</p><p>When we are in Zone C, we think we have power and authority in our pockets. We used to saying why do you always disappoint me and how dare you?</p><p><strong>Eventually,Zone A is a brave choice.</strong></p><p>There are also references to the self-states of children, adults and parents, which is a good way to clarify yourself. But I think one of the things that helped me a lot in the book was the idea of looking at the state of the self as an outsider.</p><h2 id="Genuinely-respond-to-the-needs-of-the-present"><a href="#Genuinely-respond-to-the-needs-of-the-present" class="headerlink" title="Genuinely respond to the needs of the present"></a>Genuinely respond to the needs of the present</h2><p>In fact, we don’t have to secretly or unconsciously cooperate with others to create unhappiness. How long are we going to blame others for our unhappiness? We should live a real life, sincerely respond to the needs of the moment, and find the real self, in order to break the causal cycle brought by childhood and free ourselves from the shackles of past experiences.</p><h2 id="Self-testify-prophecy"><a href="#Self-testify-prophecy" class="headerlink" title="Self-testify prophecy"></a>Self-testify prophecy</h2><p>Sometimes we get used to using self-corroborating prophecies to control events in advance to make sure they come true. Through this process, we assume the feelings of others and assign blame to ourselves. No criticism is stronger than self-criticism, and no judge is more critical than ourselves. But we need to make the transition from blame to responsibility, realizing that we have the power to change the situation and ourselves.</p><blockquote><p>It may be harsh to say, Toad, but the only person who can help you is you and only you. There are many questions you need to ask yourself. Can you stop being self-critical? Can you be kind to yourself? Perhaps the most important question is, can you begin to love yourself?</p></blockquote>]]></content>
